# Ecommerce-data-analysis-assignment

In this assignment I've worked on an ecommerce dataset. My objective was to come up with insights from the data that can help maximize profit for the company.


# Tools used & my approach

MS Excel, Python, Google Colab, PowerBI

1. Loaded 'SampleDataset.csv' on Excel to get acquainted with the data.
2. Imported the csv file in google colab to understand the data better by performing EDA using python. Was able to find few key metrics on which I could focus while working on data visualization. The notebook is named 'ecommerce_eda.ipynb'
3. Loaded the dataset in Power BI for the interactive visualization of my key findings. The file name is 'ecommerce_dataset.pbix'
4. Tried to make the dashboards appealing.

Please find 'SampleDataset.csv', 'ecommerce_eda.ipynb' & 'ecommerce_dataset.pbix' files above for reference.


# Key insights

## A. Working on the Loss making category | 'Furniture' Category

1. 'Furniture' Category is accounting for around 32% of the total sales but is able to yield just 6.44% of the total profit. Especially due to the 'Tables' sub category our profit is getting serverly impacted. We can think of avoiding 'Tables' in 'East', 'Central', 'South' region. We can still think of penetrating with 'Tables' in 'West' region where the sub-category is still quite profitable.

2. Like 'Tables' there is one more sub category named 'Bookcases'.  We can think of avoiding 'Bookcases' in 'East', 'Central', 'West' region. We can still think of penetrating with 'Tables' in 'South' region where the sub-category is still quite profitable.

## B. Boosting the best | 'Technology' Category & 'West' Region

'Technology' seems to be the best performing category for us. In this category the sales of sub categories like 'Copiers' & 'Accessories' can be increased across all the segements to bolster our profit, especially in the 'West' Region.

For example we can think of diverting our focus from Furniture (especially: Tables, Bookcases & Chairs from the West) to Technology (especially: 'Copiers', 'Accessories', 'Phones')


## C. The best discount

We can think of discounts in the range of 10-30% as they the range would not only increase our sales but will also keep us quite profitable.


## D. Portfolio mix

We can surely think of promoting few sub-categories for different segments.

For example: For 'Corporate' segment we can think of promoting 'Copiers' and 'Accessories' from the Technology sub-category + 'Paper' from the Office Supplies category & at the same time we can decrease our focus from 'Chairs', and 'Tables' from the Furniture Category + 'Machines' from the Technology category.

## E. I will keep on adding more insights as I come across. Till the time please check out the dashboards in 'ecommerce_dataset.pbix' file that I've made using Power BI.

Attaching screenshots of the dashboards for reference. Please find above or Click <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VimalChamyal/ecommerce-data-analysis/main/ecommerce_dataset.pbix">here</a> for the 'ecommerce_dataset.pbix' file.
